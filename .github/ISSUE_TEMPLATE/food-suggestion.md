## Details
<!-- Stuff like name, effects, etc... -->
<!-- Only the name is required -->

## Recipe (optional)
<!-- 
Some tips for the recipe:
- Don't focus too much on making it realistic, just the list of ingredients and tools is usually good enough
- On the other hand, don't be afraid to also suggest an intermediate product (like tapioca pearls for the boba tea recipe) or a completely new plant/resource, as long as that new plant/resource is pretty common enough and may possibly be used in more recipes in the future.
